The Relay SDK for Node.js enables Node.js developers to connect and use SignalWire's Relay APIs within their own Node.js code. Our Relay SDK allows developers to build or add robust and innovative communication services to their applications.

## Getting Started

Read the implementation documentation, guides and API Reference at the official [Relay SDK for Node.js Documentation](https://docs.signalwire.com/topics/relay-sdk-nodejs) site.

Relay SDK for Node.js is open source and maintained by the SignalWire team, but we are very grateful for [everyone](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-node/contributors) who has contributed and assisted so far.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to visit our [Slack channel](https://signalwire.community/) and read our developer section to get the code running in your local environment.

## Developers

The Node.js SDK is a package inside the [signalwire-node](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-node) _monorepo_. To setup the dev environment follow these steps:

1. [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for the LTS version of Node.js. This is the best way to also [install npm](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm#_=_).
2. Fork the [signalwire-node](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-node) repository and clone it.
3. Create a new branch from `master` for your change.
4. Run `npm install` to install global dependencies.
5. Run `npm run setup node` to prepare the Node.js package.
6. Navigate into the Node directory with `cd packages/node`.
7. Make changes!
