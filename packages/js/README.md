# SignalWire JavaScript SDK


[![Build Status](https://ci.signalwire.com/api/badges/signalwire/signalwire-node/status.svg)](https://ci.signalwire.com/signalwire/signalwire-node) ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@signalwire/js.svg?color=brightgreen) 

The JavaScript SDK transforms your standard browser into a realtime media engine, enabling developers to directly make audio and video calls to phone numbers, SIP endpoints, and other browsers. Using the JavaScript SDK you can add immersive, scalable communication - from video conferences and softphones to click-to-call and mobile gaming - all available right in your own web pages and applications.

## Getting Started
